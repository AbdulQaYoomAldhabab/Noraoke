# Noraoke

Noraoke is an Android karaoke app prototype combining experiences and interactions of western karaoke and korean norebang. It explores the concept of having groups interacting through a shared playlist, with audio synchronizing across all devices through websockets for a more social karaoke experience.

This project was developed for the course Human-Computer Interaction at Kaist, South Korea by Adrian Blanco as the app developer and Amaraa Narengerel and Juan Montalvan as designers.
