# Noraoke

Noraoke is a karaoke app prototype bridging the experiences and interactions of western karaoke and korean norebang for a more modern age. It explores the concept of having groups interacting through a shared playlist, with audio synchronizing across all devices through websockets for a more social experience.

This project was developed for the course Human-Computer Interaction at Kaist, South Korea by me (Adrian Blanco) as the app developer and Amaraa Narengerel and Juan Montalvan as designers.
